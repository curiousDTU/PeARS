### Who are you?

I'm Aurelie. I'm a computational semanticist. Go and visit my work page to find out about how computers can analyse contemporary poetry, what is special about cocktail names, what computational linguistics can tell us about the way people speak about gender and race, and other slightly geekier things.

### How is PeARS different from other distributed search engines like YaCy?

Well, apart from the fact that PeARS is a very small experiment in comparison to organised projects like YaCy, there is also a difference in focus. The YaCy team is doing amazing work on getting the networking aspects of distributed search to work. That is, the challenge of making thousands and thousands of peers on a network queryable in an efficient fashion. PeARS is taking another approach: how can we make sure that we query as few peers, and process as few pages as possible? I am also interested in the linguistic aspects of search. The tendency of the most successful search engines out there has been to gather as much data as possible and do as dumb linguistic processing as possible. If we were more focused in selecting the data we search, we could start being clever again in interpreting and disambiguating user queries, perform direct question answering or even summarising on-the-fly. In my mind, this requires some serious models of how language works and people convey meaning.

### What about privacy?

PeARS fully respects your privacy. One big advantage of all distributed search engines is that your searches are not sent to one big company, which is free to store and analyse them, but to thousands of individual people, which makes you much less tractable. The only thing you share about yourself is your IP address. The part of your search history you make available to other people on the network is completely up to you. You can choose to just share your Wikipedia searches, or admit to your obsession for salted licorice (in an anonymous way â€“ it is your IP address that is linked to those pages, not you).

### But I like being visible!

If you're a social network fan, feel free to customise your pi with as much information as you like. That information will be visible to people who use your pi in their search. Who knows, you might create a real community of people interested in a topic, and start sharing your best search tips with those people.

### I like being visible and private at the same time!

No problem. Have one pi for your private persona, and one for your social networking. Choose which domains you share privately, and which publicly.
