  <h1>What is PeARS?</h1>

Imagine a new kind of Internet search. When you have a query, instead of going
to a big, centralised search engine, well, you just ask someone! "Nicole,
where can I find some cool fabric for my new dress?", "James, how do I get
from Orly airport to the Gare du Nord in Paris?", "Jane, what is a cruck
barn?" Of course, Nicole, James and Jane are not waiting in front of their
computer, ready to answer your queries. Nor do they have time to compile a
database of every single thing they know. Instead, they each own a raspberry
pi where they store some of their (processed) search history. When you send
your query over the Internet, a bunch of pis take care of it and send you
search results based on the knowledge, expertise and preferences of their
owners â€“ all of this, of course, entirely anonymously. The PeARS project
(Peer-to-peer Agent for Reciprocated Search) is a little experiment
investigating how this would all work in practice.
