title:  "P8: Document retrieval"
---

At the query topicalisation stage, we produced a list of pis that may hold the answer to the user query, together with a list of topics, for each pi, which may be relevant to the search. The topicaliseQueryBrowser.py script produced a little file, pi-topics.tmp, which holds this information. Now, we know exactly which pears on the network we should query, and which of the pages we should process to try and find the most relevant ones. compareQuerySentenceBrowser.py (available [here](https://github.com/minimalparts/PeARS)) deals with all of this and returns results to the main mkQueryPage.py script, which will display them in our browser.

### Procedure

The topicaliseQueryBrowser.py script achieves the following:

*    read the pi-topics.tmp file, and store the addresses of the pis to query, together with the relevant topics;
*    connect to each pi and read the local .doc.topics.index files (created in that step) to find out which documents have been classified under the topics we are interested in;
*    for each document identified as potentially relevant, get that documentâ€™s representation (obtained in that step) and compare each sentence to the query, using a simple bag-of-words approach; use sentence scores to produce an overall document score;
*    return scores and document URLs to mkQueryPage.py
