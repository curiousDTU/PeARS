So quite a lot about breeds of dogs (from Wikipedia), as well as an interesting BBC article about how the way a dog wags his tail is correlated with his or her mood (I am getting BBC results because I have processed some of their pages â€“ if you only have Wikipedia available on your pi, you will obviously only get Wikipedia pages). We have a working search engine!
